# Go APNs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mattprice/Go-APNs.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mattprice/Go-APNs)

**Work In Progress:** A Golang package for easily connecting and sending notifications to the Apple Push Notification Service. We abstract all the quirks and difficulties of the APNs so that you can focus on your application.

## Features
* **Based on a [queue system](http://redth.info/the-problem-with-apples-push-notification-ser/ "The Problem with Apple's Push Notification Service") instead of timeouts.** All your notifications will be delivered without sacrificing speed.
* **Certificates can be passed as a string or file path.** This allows you to store your certificates anywhere you wantâ€”in a database, environmental variable, or on disk.
* **Simplifies creating the notification payload.** You can start focusing on what you need your notifications to do instead of Apple's API.
* **Creates a persistent connection to Apple's server.** This is recommended by Apple, and it allows you to send notifications faster by avoiding multiple, costly SSL handshakes.
